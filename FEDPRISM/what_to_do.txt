these are four algorithms , and i wanna benchmark them , the 1st algorithm is my own algortihm , rest are already therr
use cifar100 , cifar 10 , svhn , fmnist , all these datasets

but make it highly non iid using dirchilet 0.5 ,0.3 and 0.1 , giving some classes common and most classes uncommon discjoint (to ensure that different clusters are fomred) , patholoical

NOTE: use le net 50 for the models , i want total 100 clients to be used , 
use combinations of 100 and 300 communication rounds.

CLIENT SAMPLE FRACTION	LOCAL EPOCHS	BATCH SIZE	OPTIMIZER CONFIG	COMM ROUNDS	LEARNING RATE
0.1	10	32	SGD 0.9 100	0.01.

use comibnation of the differnet daset and hte idffenrt kinds of distubutons and track and keep note of all epeirments



so to summarize i want multipel runs of all algorthms benchmarked across these datst , save data and plots for each algorithm for each run about the kind of data used for every client , the reasons for the cluster 
and most imprntaly the plots for the clusters as well as overall performance , and test on global test sets as well as local test sets for each clients as well. the main aim is that the comparison should be uniform 

I Wanna publish a paepr , so all the runs have to be very consitnet and repeatable  ,and save pltos for all.

i just wanna run a main file once that runs everyhting and give me the results. all results compared at once and indidually also , with formal report .
